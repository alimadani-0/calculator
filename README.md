### Reflection

This project proved to be a lot more difficult than I had initially expected. This is not due to any technical reasons; the actual coding process and troubleshooting was fun. What caused me to scratch my head a tad bit was the planning required. 

I typically like to plan the logic out for a project before getting started. There was a lot of intertwined functionality in this project where, for example, a '+' operator may behave differently after a digit than after the '=' button. Navigating this complexity was challenging especially due to my ever-present desire to write modular code, and it highlighted a new area to grow in.

This is also the first project that allowed me to constantly run into bugs as I continued to develop it that have otherwise gone unnoticed.
